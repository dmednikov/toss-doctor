    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 text-center">
      At Toss Doctor, we're passionate about helping tennis players build a stronger foundation â€” 
      one toss at a time. Our mission is to improve serve consistency through smart, 
      practical training tools designed for players of all levels.

      We believe the toss is the most overlooked yet critical part of the serve. 
      With our innovative training device, players can isolate and master the toss 
      mechanics â€” improving precision, confidence, and overall performance on the court.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Toss Doctor was born from a courtside conversation between two lifelong tennis enthusiasts â€” 
        Jane Doe and John Smith â€” who noticed a common thread among players of all levels: 
        inconsistent toss mechanics. Despite the toss being essential to every serve, there were 
        no accessible tools to help players perfect it.

        Combining Janeâ€™s business and product insight with Johnâ€™s technical and engineering background, 
        they set out to build a device that would make toss training visual, measurable, and repeatable. 
        From early prototypes in the garage to field tests with local players and coaches, 
        Toss Doctor has grown into a purpose-driven company focused on improving performance through 
        simple, smart design.
