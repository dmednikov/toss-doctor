          <h2 class="card-title">Target Ring Adjustment (Controlled Toss Height)</h2>
          <p>The Toss Trainer features an adjustable target ring that allows 
              players to set and control the desired toss height with precision. 
              By sliding the ring up or down along the telescoping arm, users 
              can customize the target position to match their optimal toss 
              height, ensuring every practice session is tailored to their 
              serve technique. This helps develop muscle memory for a consistent, 
              repeatable toss, whether you’re aiming for a high, powerful 
              serve or a lower, more controlled toss. The easy-to-adjust 
              mechanism makes it quick to set up for players of all ages 
              and skill levels.</p>
              <ul>
                Benefits:
                <li>Builds consistency in toss height</li>
                <li>Adapts to various serve types and player preferences</li>
                <li>Provides immediate visual feedback for every toss</li>
                <li>Encourages proper toss technique and body alignment</li>

          <h2 class="card-title">Controlled toss release point</h2>
          <p>The Toss Trainer is designed with a built-in guide to help players 
            release the ball from a consistent point during their toss. This 
            feature trains athletes to let go of the ball at the correct 
            moment—neither too early nor too late—by aligning their hand with
             a fixed reference marker (such as a horizontal bar, ring, or 
             visual cue) at the ideal release zone. By reinforcing a stable 
             release point, the trainer helps eliminate erratic tosses and 
             supports a smooth, upward toss trajectory.</p>
