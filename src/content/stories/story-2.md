I brought the Toss Trainer to the local courts early in the morning. It drew a few curious looks, but once I set it up—tripod stable, arm extended, ring adjusted—I was locked in. My biggest issue has always been tossing too far forward or to the side. With the ring acting as a visual checkpoint, I could finally see the path the ball needed to take. After a few shaky tries, I started getting clean, centered tosses right through the ring. The feedback was instant—either I hit the target or I didn’t. It turned what used to be guesswork into a measurable skill. I stayed out longer than planned. Just me, the ball, and a simple device that actually made a difference.
