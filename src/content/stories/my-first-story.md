Taking the Toss Trainer out onto the court was a game-changer. Setup was quick—just unfolded the tripod, adjusted the height, and aligned the ring. Within minutes, I was working on my serve toss with a level of consistency I hadn’t felt before. The controlled release point really forced me to focus on technique, not just repetition. Even with a bit of wind, the sturdy base held firm. After 20 minutes, I could already feel the improvement in my rhythm and timing. Packing it down was just as easy—lightweight, foldable, and fit right next to my racket bag. This thing’s a must-have for serious serve practice.
